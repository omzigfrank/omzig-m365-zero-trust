# Project State

## Project Reference

Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Per-tenant DB isolation (elastic pool) is load-bearing -- must be proven in Phase 1 before any audit data flows
- [Roadmap]: Drift detection uses audit log polling, NOT Graph webhooks (webhooks don't support CA/Intune/DLP resources)
- [Roadmap]: Remediation and drift are last phases due to highest consequence of errors
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 and Phase 4 can execute in parallel after Phase 2 completes
- [Roadmap]: Auth-06 (minimum-privilege Graph scopes) assigned to Phase 2 since scoping happens when the audit engine first calls Graph
- [Phase 1]: 4-role RBAC model (Owner/Admin/Analyst/Read-only) with Entra app roles + per-tenant database overrides
- [Phase 1]: Multi-org SaaS model with shared infra and org-level isolation
- [Phase 1]: Explicit tenant access (no implicit access to all tenants)
- [Phase 1]: Platform-enforced MFA validation (checks JWT claims, defense-in-depth)
- [Phase 1]: Setup wizard with full onboarding flow including first audit run
- [Phase 1]: Always Encrypted for sensitive columns, opaque tenant DB names
